A very quick correctness test of F-SAPT with external potentials in A, B, and C.

Test case fsapt1 explains the fsapt output files. In addition to what is written there,
the example here generates two output files: Extern_A.xyz and Extern_B.xyz. These files
contains the coordinates for the user-defined external potentials. These coordinates
are added to the PDB files generated by running the fsapt.py script.
